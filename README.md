2. **Random Number Generation:** A random number is generated within a defined range at the beginning of each round.
3. **Player Input:** Players can enter their guesses for the generated number.
4. **Feedback to Players:** After each guess, the game provides feedback indicating if the guess was too high or too low.
5. **Attempts Counter:** The game keeps track of the number of attempts made by the player.
6. **Winning Condition:** The game ends when the player correctly guesses the random number.
7. **Difficulty Levels:** Players can choose different difficulty levels that modify the range and allowed attempts.
