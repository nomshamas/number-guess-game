## Project Description
The Number Guessing Game is a simple and entertaining project that challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. It's designed to provide users with a fun experience while enhancing their logical thinking and decision-making skills.

## Features

2. **Random Number Generation:** A random number is generated within a defined range at the beginning of each round.
3. **Player Input:** Players can enter their guesses for the generated number.
4. **Feedback to Players:** After each guess, the game provides feedback indicating if the guess was too high or too low.
5. **Attempts Counter:** The game keeps track of the number of attempts made by the player.
6. **Winning Condition:** The game ends when the player correctly guesses the random number.
7. **Difficulty Levels:** Players can choose different difficulty levels that modify the range and allowed attempts.
8. **High Score Tracking:** Optionally, a high score system can be implemented to track the best scores.
9. **Play Again:** Players can start a new game after completing one.
